          FloSports offers coverage and live streaming for a wide range of
          sports, from wrestling to racing, accessible via various platforms
          including iOS and Android. The apps feature a schedule which allows
          customers to stay informed about upcoming events, games, and matches
          for their favorite sports.
        </p>

        <p class="content-section__body">
          The schedule feature was sufficient in the early days of the business,
          but FloSports was introducing thousands of new events to their
          offering, and had aspirations of eventually providing additional
          features such as live scores.
        </p>
        <p class="content-section__body">
          I was tasked with redesigning the schedule to better support the
          influx of new events and lay the groundwork for the future.

          I began the project by conducting some high level exploration of

          what’s happening next month.

          Integrating scores into the schedule was not within scope for the
          first phase of the project. However, we knew this was something our

          some exploration to envision what that integration might look like.
