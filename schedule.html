          Integrating scores into the schedule was not within scope for the
          first phase of the project. However, we knew this was something our
          customers would love, and that we eventually wanted to do. So, I did
          some exploration to envision what that integration might look like.

        <p class="text-body">
          Customers frequently use date as a way to categorize events. So, we
          introduced features that let customers seamlessly navigate through
          time, whether they’re interested in what’s happening tomorrow, or
          what’s happening next month.
